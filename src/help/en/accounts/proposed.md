# Proposed Transactions

With the feature of proposals, anyone can submit a transaction to the blockchain with a "Proposed" action.
This is an advanced feature and it allows you to suggest actions of accounts you do not control yourself.

For example, an account can be a multi-sig of several other accounts. One of the parties submit a proposal
(e.g. the transfer of some asset), and the others accounts being part of the multi-sig approve the proposal.
When it surpasses the threshold, the proposal is executed.

If one have been submitted to your account without you expecting one, be very careful.
If you don't know the account that proposed something for you, ignore it, even if the account name sounds familiar.
When in doubt, always contact third parties directly, such as gateways, bridges or other accounts.

A proposed transaction has an expiration date, and when that is surpassed, the proposal will disappear by itself.
